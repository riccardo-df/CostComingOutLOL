\description{
Uses a diff-in-diff strategy to investigate the impact of the coming-out event on players' performance.
}
\details{
We define two versions of the treatment.
\describe{
   \item{\code{ReduceGraves}}{Players that reduce their average pick rate for Graves following his disclosure are considered treated.}
   \item{\code{DropGraves}}{Players that had a non-zero average pick rate for Graves before his disclosure and transition to a zero pick rate after are considered treated.}
}

Two-way fixed effect regressions are employed to estimate the impact of the coming-out event on the performance of treated players. These regressions are consistent for the average treatment
effect on the treated under the assumptions of no anticipation and parallel trends.\cr

We also use the estimator of Callaway and Santâ€™Anna (2021) as a robustness check. This is implemented using the \code{\link[did]{att_gt}} function. Technical details are given in the associated documentation.
To summarize ideas, this estimates the average treatment effect on the treated for all time t > \code{treatment_date} (effects before that date are also estimated and are useful to check the plausibility
of the parallel trend assumption). We fit the estimator both unconditionally and conditional on pre-treatment covariates (average kills, assists, deaths, gold earned, and matches played each day).\cr

\code{treatment_date}, \code{min_date}, and \code{max_date} must be created by \code{as.POSIXct("YYYY-MM-DD", tryFormats = "\%Y-\%m-\%d")}.\cr

Players that have played less than \code{n_pre_matches} before \code{treatment_date} or less than \code{n_post_matches} between \code{treatment_date} and \code{max_date} are dropped. The number of
players remaining in the data set is printed.
