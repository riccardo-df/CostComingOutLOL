did_players_performance(
  n_pre_matches,
  filter = "prior_users",
  treatment_date = as.POSIXct("2022-06-01", tryFormats = "\%Y-\%m-\%d"),

}
\arguments{
\item{n_pre_matches}{How many matches before \code{treatment_date} players must have played to be kept in the data set.}

\item{filter}{Which players to retain for the analysis.}

\item{treatment_date}{Object of class \code{POSIXct}. The date of the treatment.}

\item{min_date}{Object of class \code{POSIXct}. Where to start the series.}

\item{max_date}{Object of class \code{POSIXct}. Where to end the series.}
}
\value{
Returns a list with \code{treatment_date} and all the diff-in-diff results. The user can post-process the output using the \code{\link{plot_did}} function.
}
\description{
Uses a diff-in-diff strategy to investigate the impact of the coming-out event on players' performance.
}
\details{
We define three versions of the treatment.

\describe{
   \item{\code{Any reduction}}{Players that reduce their average pick rate for Graves by any amount following his disclosure are considered treated.}
   \item{\code{Substantial reduction}}{Players that reduce their average pick rate for Graves by at least 50\% following his disclosure are considered treated.}
   \item{\code{Complete abandomnent}}{Players that had a non-zero average pick rate for Graves before his disclosure and transition to a zero pick rate after are considered treated.}
}

Notice that the categories are not mutually exclusive: those that are considered treated under \code{Complete abandomnent} are also treated under \code{Any reduction} (the opposite is not true).
We keep the control group fixed as it is always composed of those prior-users that do not reduce their pick rates for Graves at all.\cr

The estimators of Callaway and Santâ€™Anna (2021) are employed to estimate the impact of the coming-out event on the performance of treated players. This is implemented using the \code{\link[did]{att_gt}} function.
Technical details are given in the associated documentation. To summarize, we identify and estimate the average treatment effect on the treated for all time t > \code{treatment_date}. "Effects" before that date are
also estimated and are useful to check the plausibility of the parallel trend assumption. We consider both the unconditional estimator and the doubly-robust estimator that conditions on pre-treatment covariates
(average kills, assists, deaths, gold earned, and matches played each day).\cr

\code{treatment_date}, \code{min_date}, and \code{max_date} must be created by \code{as.POSIXct("YYYY-MM-DD", tryFormats = "\%Y-\%m-\%d")}.\cr

Players that have played less than \code{n_pre_matches} before \code{treatment_date} or that never played after are dropped. The number of players remaining in the data set is printed in the console.
Moreover, additional players are removed if the \code{filter} argument is not set to \code{"all"}. If this is set to \code{"prior_users"}, then only players that used to play Graves before
his disclosure are used in the analysis.
