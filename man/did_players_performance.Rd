\item{treatment_date}{Object of class \code{POSIXct}. The date of the treatment.}

\item{min_date}{Object of class \code{POSIXct}. Where to start the series.}

\description{
Uses a diff-in-diff strategy to investigate the impact of the coming-out event on players' performance.
}
\details{
We define two versions of the treatment.
\describe{
   \item{\code{ReduceGraves}}{Players that reduce their average pick rate for Graves following his disclosure are considered treated.}
   \item{\code{DropGraves}}{Players that had a non-zero average pick rate for Graves before his disclosure and transition to a zero pick rate after are considered treated.}
}

The estimators of Callaway and Santâ€™Anna (2021) are employed to estimate the impact of the coming-out event on the performance of treated players. This is implemented using the \code{\link[did]{att_gt}} function.
Technical details are given in the associated documentation. To summarize, we identify and estimate the average treatment effect on the treated for all time t > \code{treatment_date}. "Effects" before that date are
also estimated and are useful to check the plausibility of the parallel trend assumption. We consider both the unconditional estimator and the doubly-robust estimator that conditions on pre-treatment covariates
(average kills, assists, deaths, gold earned, and matches played each day).\cr

\code{treatment_date}, \code{min_date}, and \code{max_date} must be created by \code{as.POSIXct("YYYY-MM-DD", tryFormats = "\%Y-\%m-\%d")}.\cr

Players that have played less than \code{n_pre_matches} before \code{treatment_date} or less than \code{n_post_matches} between \code{treatment_date} and \code{max_date} are dropped. The number of
players remaining in the data set is printed.
